Frontend Bootstrap
==================

Use this repository as a starting point to any new project or idea.

Each project must have its own folder at projects/ folder to store all files related to that project.

All common assets like css, fonts, images, javascripts and language translations - that can be reused by other projects - should be stored at common-assets/ folder.

Commit messages in english are encouraged and will be required for production environments.
